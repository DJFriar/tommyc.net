## Summary Statement

I am a “pragmatic idealist” with over 25 years experience in the computer industry. I am an effective communicator with excellent leadership skills and am a productive team player who does not crack under pressure. Knowledge is something that I am continually in pursuit of, and I am fortunate to be a very quick learner with a fantastic memory and great organization skills. Beyond the skills and experiences listed below I am very comfortable in front of large audiences, enjoy a good challenge, and am not easily frustrated.

## Work Experience

### Development Project Manager | Yardi Systems | Jan 2015 - Present

Yardi Systems is the worldwide leader in property accounting software. My primary role as project manager is to coordinate, schedule, and manage multiple ongoing projects across multiple disciplines, both client facing and internal. My team consists of 11 developers and QA engineers located throughout the US as well as in Pune, India. Product functionalities and improvements are a combination of my own team’s initiatives, as well as requests from clients, other departments, and senior management. I also work closely with our eLearning teams to create internal and external curriculum, with our marketing team as both a process improvement manager and as an instructor at our nationwide industry conferences, and with our executive management team to create standardized processes and workflows. My technical background allows me to assist as needed with some lower level programming and reporting tasks, as well as serve as the technical escalation point for my team’s products. Software usage includes Office 365, JIRA, Confluence, SharePoint, MS SQL, Trello, and Visual Studio in an Agile Scrum based environment. Development experience includes .Net, Java, JavaScript, CSS, Swift 4, React, and Angular.

### Support Lead | medQ | Sep 2013 - Jan 2015

medQ is the creator and seller of a radiology management software suite. My role here was to coordinate support between our clients and our engineers and developers located in Romania. I was also responsible for managing the ticketing system (SysAid), providing all in-house IT services, and training end users in our products. I worked closely with the developers and quality control team to report feature requests and bugs, ensure that patches and updates passed validation and assisted in implementation duties for both new and existing clients. As a lead, I managed two support technicians, served as the primary point of contact for our larger strategic clients, and was also part of the on-call rotation for one week every four weeks.

## GitHub Highlights

### Tour of Honor (iOS & Android)

The Tour of Honor is an annual motorcycle rally running from April 1st through October 31st that honors veterans and first responders. As a volunteer contributor, my mobile applications are the official apps for the rally and facilitate easier, more orderly bonus submission by the riders, as well as glanceable, offline access to the rally data for the riders. I am also leading an overhaul of their website that will eliminate the email based submission methods that are employed today; this project is targeted for an early 2022 launch.

### Full Stack Web Developer Boot Camp at SMU Cox

I am currently enrolled in SMU Cox's Full Stack Web Developer Boot Camp where I have maintained a 4.0 GPA with an expected graduation date of March 24th, 2021. As our world becomes increasingly reliant upon SaaS style systems, I felt it important to ensure that I was skilled and comfortable not only with app level code, but also the front end and back end of the web sites that will service them. This course is built upon JavaScript, with a direct focus on jQuery, Node.js, and React.
