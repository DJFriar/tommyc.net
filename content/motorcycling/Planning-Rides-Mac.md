A few people have asked about planning rides without Basecamp. As I don't own a Garmin device, I can't use Basecamp, so I never have. Additionally, Garmin indicated they were going to stop updating it, so I never felt it was a big deal to learn it. So here I thought I'd explain how I plan and execute my rides.

## Software Used

### macOS

- Road Trip Planner
- Apple Numbers
- Google Maps

### iOS

- Road Trip Planner

## My Method

The two main things I plan for today are IBA certified rides or Big Money Rally (BMR) runs. My approach is bascially the same for both though.

1. Create the rough route in Road Trip Planner
1. Shape and add/or add bonuses as needed
1. Save the RTP file to iCloud

This lets me get a quick overview and rough time estimate of my route.
