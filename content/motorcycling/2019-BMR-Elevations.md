I'm pretty sure RenoJohn is nuts, but he could just be that devilishly genius, too. Regardless, here is a easier to use lookup for the Elevation bonuses (EV and RG). I created it in Numbers and exported it to Excel, so it should work for all, but I haven't tested the Excel version.

#### BMR Elevations Lookup
