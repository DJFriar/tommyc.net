The day was unexpectedly nice, so I took out the bike and decided to head down to Deep Ellum to take some photos. I took a roundabout way there to collect some point for the BMR, so I arrived in Deep Ellum around 3pm. Here are some highlight shots from the day.

The colors of this mural drew me in, but I love that I got the guy looking at me in the shot, too.

I spotted this over one of the parking lots and thought it looked neat.

This was the mural outside of Select Start, which is a gaming arcade in Deep Ellum.

This motorcycle shot was my favorite from the day.
