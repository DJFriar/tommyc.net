Slightly over 11 years ago, the very first iPhone was released. I acquired mine a few weeks later, essentially via peer pressure. I can still recall the feeling of magic I felt as I first used it, as well as how clearly I knew it was the start of something much, much bigger. It was also then that I knew I wanted to make apps for this newfangled device, I wanted to become an indie developer.

Earlier this morning, that dream came true. My very first iOS app is now for sale on the App Store, with my own name underneath it.

Officially, I started this specific app 114 days ago, on April 1st. But in reality, this is the culmination of an idea and a dream that began 11 years ago.

Today, I can finally say: I am an App Developer.
