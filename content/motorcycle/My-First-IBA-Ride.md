In June I completed my first IBA ride, earning me IBA # 72302. I rode from Dallas, TX to Buellton, CA though offically my path was Wautauga, TX to Santa Barbara, CA due to a false start and finding an ending witness. I was able to nest a SaddleSore 1000 inside a Bun Burner 1500 Silver, completing 1,527 miles in 27 hours and 3 minutes.

I left Watauga at 5:00am on the dot and headed out onto I-820. Traffic was light and it didn't take long to reach I-20.
