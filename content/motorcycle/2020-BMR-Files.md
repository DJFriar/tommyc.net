The 2020 BMR is quickly approaching! Like many of the more ... committed ... riders, I make various files to help me in my planning. Last year I started sharing a few of them and figured I may as well continue the trend.

#### Individual GPX files for each bonus set

The 3-Day Rally one I made, the Airports one is courtesy of Jerry White.

- [3-Day Rally (DR)](/gpx/2020_BMR_DR.gpx)
- [Airports (AF/FA)](/gpx/2020_BMR_AF-FA.gpx)

#### Tracking Spreadsheet

This is coming soon. I have the framework completed if you really, really want it, but I don't plan on posting it until the updated bonus packet is released that contains all the word of the day/hour bonuses as well as the point values.
