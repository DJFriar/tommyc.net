The 2020 BMR is upon us!! Last year I shared some documents I made, and this year a few people have graciously offered their own support documents and asked me to host them. So below you will find all the various documents that have been shared with me and/or created by me.

*Please note that the Airports one was programatically generated via a script and therefore is not 100% accurate. Also note that this a word match: the picture you submit does not have to be an airport, an athletic field or other permanent signage is perfectly acceptable.

#### Tracking Spreadsheets

|[2020 BMR Tracker (Numbers)](/bmr/2020_BMR_Tracker.numbers)   |Tommy Craft   |22 Dec 2019   |

*I do all my work in Apple Numbers, so that version is the best one to use if you have a Mac. For you Windows/Excel people I have exported my Numbers spreadsheet out to Excel for you. In my testing, everything works fine, except that Numbers supports checkboxes, and Excel makes them into True/False fields. If you mark one of these as True, all the calculations sem to work as expected.
