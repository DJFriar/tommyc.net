Once the route is planned and loaded up on my iPhone/iPad, its time to hit the road and ride the plan. This page will explain how I track my rides and then how I process them once I get home.

## Software Used

### iOS

- Road Trip Planner
- Trails
- SWConnect
- Apple Numbers
- Apple Maps
- Google Maps
- iBMR (for BMR related runs)
- Fuelly (nothing to do with BMR or IBA, I just have always used this app)

### macOS

- Road Trip Planner
- Google Maps
- Google Earth
- Apple Numbers

## My Method

### Getting Started

I ride a Honda Gold Wing Tour, which has CarPlay built in. Therefore, I ride with two iPhones: an iPhone 11 Pro in the glovebox plugged into the CarPlay system; and an iPhone XR mounted on the handlebars. The 11 Pro  is my personal device, and handles music and navigation. The XR is my work device, and handles tracking duties. Additionally, this setup also gives me two carriers on different technologies (T-Mobile and Verizon, respectively. Each device acts as a backup to the other one.

Before I start, I turn on SWConnect and enable the tracking. I also open up Trails and begin a new track with Motorcycle selected as the track type. I tap on the navgation arrow in the lower right to ensure it is updating with my current location, and then I lock the screen with Trails in the foreground. Lastly I reset both my Trip A and Trip B odmoeters. I use A for fuel stop to fuel stop and B for tracking the overall trip.

I generally use Apple Maps for my navigation (with the execption being large cities where i use Waze for the traffic avoidance benefits). I start my ride by entering the first destination into Apple Maps. In the Road Trip Planner (RTP) app, it will lookup GPS coordinates to provide a street address, which is what I enter if it doesn't have a proper name I can use (like "IKEA Frisco").

### Fuel Stops

If I'm on a BMR run, fuel stops don't mean anything so other than entering my fill up into Fuelly, I will usually unlock the XR to check on Trails. It is always working fine when I do this, but its a habit that won't hurt anything so I still do it.

If I'm on an IBA ride, I will start by getting a receipt from the fuel pump/station attendant. Then I'll enter the fill up into Fuelly. I'll reset my Trip A odometer, then switch to the bike odometer to grab a pic of the bike's mileage with my DBR. I always do this with my iPhone XR*. I then put the receipt in the ziplock bag I keep in the trunk and head back out on the road. I also make a custom waypoint using SWConnect.

*Helpful Tip: I shoot all my receipts using the Square aspect ratio. This lets the image file size be smaller, and it will also be easier to read later as the picture is focused on just the required details.

### Bonus Stop (BMR)

When I stop for a bonus stop,
