Over the weekend I got to finally complete a Tour of Honor ride. I had signed up in 2018, but never got the chance to participate that year.

After looking at the California bonuses I figured I could do a SaddleSore 1000 Extreme and hit all 7 bonuses. I would head generally north and if I included my return home, could net a BunBurner Extreme as well.

My planned route took me east out of Santa Barbara to Mojave where I'd turn north to head up US-395. Just before South Lake Tahoe I turn west again until San Francisco, where I turn northeasterly back over to Susanville. Then I'd beeline it back to Santa Barbara to close out the ride.

### Santa Barbara to Mojave

6:50am, let's get this show on the road. WIth a full tank of gas I'm outta here. South on 101 to eastbound 126 went super smooth with hardly any traffic. Next was supposed to be south on I-5 to 14 West, but the offramp to I-5 south was closed. A quick glance at the map made these seem like a straightforward detour, just stay on 126 and then take a side street to the 14. However the GPS had a totally different idea, and wanted me to head through the Newhall Ranch neighborhood and then onto San Francisquito Road. I decided to see what the GPS had in mind, and it turned out to be a fantastic road. A moderatly twisty canyon road with hardly any traffic, score! This road took me through Green Valley and eventually through Lancaster where I joined the 14 and headed north into Mojave.
  
### Mojave to Big Pine

Leaving Mojave I got a great close up view of the Mojave Airplane Graveyard. It would be so cool to go walk through that someday, though I'm prety sure it is restricted. After leaving Mojave I continue on to Indian Sptings to catch US-395. An hour or so of 395 brings me to Big Pine where I snagged my first Tour of Honor Memorial, which happened to be CA1.

### Big Pine to Bishop

I left Big Pine and continued north on US-395. This part of the ride was uneventful, but pretty. Mammoth Mountain was in view for a long time as the road slowly gained some elevation. US-395 makes a left turn in Bishop, so I stopped there for fuel before continuing on. Along the way, the scenery kept getting more and more interesting. Soon I was catching glimspes of a lake, and eventualy I stopped to take a pic (click it to see it full size):

It turned out to be Crowley Lake. After a few more minutes of admiration (and leg stretching) I motored on. My target destination is fueling up in Markleeville, but I have to pass Mono Lake first.

### Mono Lake - Detour

Mono Lake is just gorgeous. You start to see it in glimpses and eventually you kind of descend into it. Its truly stunning. It is so stunning, that I took a detour to the visitor center (which is really only about 1/4 mile off the main road) to catch some other views. Little did I know that the best views were yet to come. As you continue north on US-395, you continue to descend util you are at the water line next to the lake. the view from here is just incredible (excuse my crappy cell phone pics, I promise it was much better in person):
