On July 28th, 2019 the [Petersen Automotive Museum](https://www.petersen.org/ "Petersen Automotive Museum") hosted the West Coast unveiling of the 2020 Corvette, the first ever mid-engined Corvette.

As you can see, the car is stunning looking. It's performance is also stunning. 0-60 in under 3 seconds, and this is still the base model Corvette (ok, technically you need the Z51 package to do sub 3 second 0-60, but this also isn't the Z06 or ZR-1 variants either, so just imagine how insane those will be). Even more surprising was the price: under \$60,000. I can think of more than a few mid-engine supercars who just lost a lot of resale and are really hoping their names are enough to carry their price tags.

Also, if you haven't been to the [Petersen Automotive Museum](https://www.petersen.org/ "Petersen Automotive Museum") and you find yourself in Los Angeles, it's well worth the visit.
